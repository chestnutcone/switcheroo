# switcheroo
switccheroo is a schedule managing web app. Please visit the demo site https://oliverswitcheroo.herokuapp.com/ for more information. 

To runserver, clone switcheroo. After cloning, go to settings.py located in switcheroo/switcheroo/settings.py and change DEBUG=True. 
Then in your command prompt (I used Anaconda Prompt), cd into the root folder, which is where switcheroo/manage.py resides, and type
python manage.py runserver. Then open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000
